# This is a little brother of ChatGPT ðŸ¦¾
### Description
This project has been made using React and ChatGPT API. This is a test application that proves how the ChatGPT API works.

### Want to try it?
There is an example .env.example file that should store 2 keys for ChatGPT API. Please, take a look at this to configure your ChatGPT's little brother.

But first let's clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/shkholikov/ASKME-w-ChatGPT.git
```
Install project dependencies:
```
npm i
```
Now you should configure your API keys as I described above. If there is something is not clear for your, feel free to refer to the [official docs](https://github.com/shkholikov/ASKME-w-ChatGPT.git). 

Let's start it:
```
npm run start
```

Feel free to share this repo with others to show a minimal integration example of ChatGPT into your application. 

*It's a little brother of ChatGPT, don't bother him too much!*
